# Generative_Adverserial_Network on MNIST Fashion Dataset
Created a generator network which takes an input of random 128 values and generates the images as close as possible to the images present in the MNIST Dataset.
Used a discriminator network to classify between generated and actual image from the dataset.
Written a custom class to train the model of both generator and discriminator
